      <strong>Future developments</strong>.  For the latest information about
      developments related to Form W-9 and its  instructions, such as legislation
      enacted after they were published, go to <em>www.irs.gov/FormW9</em>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>
         <strong>What's  New</strong>
      </h3>
      Line 3a has been modified to clarify  how a disregarded entity completes
      this line. An LLC that is a disregarded  entity should check the appropriate
      box for the tax classification of its  owner. Otherwise, it should check the
      “LLC" box and enter its appropriate tax  classification.
      <br/>
      &ensp;New line 3b has been added to this  form. A flow-through entity is required
      to complete this line to indicate that  it has direct or indirect foreign
      partners, owners, or beneficiaries when it  provides the Form W-9 to another
      flow-through entity in which it has an  ownership interest. This change is
      intended to provide a flow-through entity  with information regarding the
      status of its indirect foreign partners, owners,  or beneficiaries, so that
      it can satisfy any applicable reporting requirements.  For example, a partnership that has any indirect foreign partners may be  required to
      complete Schedules K-2 and K-3. See the Partnership Instructions  for
      Schedules K-2 and K-3 (Form 1065).
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>
         <strong>Purpose  of Form</strong> <strong></strong>
      </h3>
      An individual or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to  file an
      information return with the IRS is giving you this form because they  must
      obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN), which may be  your
      social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number
      (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer
      identification number (EIN), to report on an information return the amount
      paid  to you, or other amount reportable on an information return. Examples
      of  information returns include, but are not limited to, the following.
      <ul >
         <li>
            Form 1099-INT (interest earned or paid).
         </li>
         <li>
            Form 1099-DIV (dividends, including those from stocks or mutual  funds).
         </li>
         <li>
            Form 1099-MISC (various types of income, prizes, awards, or  gross
            proceeds).
         </li>
         <li>
            Form 1099-NEC (nonemployee compensation).
         </li>
         <li>
            Form 1099-B (stock or mutual fund sales and certain other  transactions by
            brokers).
         </li>
         <li>
            Form 1099-S (proceeds from real estate transactions).
         </li>
         <li>
            Form 1099-K (merchant card and third-party network  transactions).
         </li>
         <li>
            Form 1098 (home mortgage interest), 1098-E (student loan  interest), and
            1098-T (tuition).
         </li>
         <li>
            Form 1099-C (canceled debt).
         </li>
         <li>
            Form 1099-A (acquisition or abandonment of secured property).
         </li>
      </ul>
      &ensp;Use Form W-9 only if you are a  U.S. person (including a resident alien), to
      provide your correct TIN.
      <br>
      <strong>Caution: </strong>If you don't  return Form W-9 to the requester with
      a TIN, you might be subject to backup  withholding. See
      <em>
      What is backup withholding
      </em>
      , later.
      <br>
      <strong>&ensp;By signing the filled-out form</strong>, you:
      <ol>
         <li>
            Certify that the TIN you are  giving is correct (or you are waiting for a
            number to be issued);
         </li>
         <li>
            Certify that you are not  subject to backup withholding; or
         </li>
         <li>
            Claim exemption from backup  withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee;
            and
         </li>
         <li>
            Certify to your non-foreign  status for purposes of withholding under
            chapter 3 or 4 of the Code (if  applicable); and
         </li>
         <li>
            Certify that FATCA code(s)  entered on this form (if any) indicating that
            you are exempt from the FATCA  reporting is correct. See
            <em>
            What Is FATCA Reporting
            </em>
            , later, for further  information.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <strong>Note: </strong>If you are a  U.S. person and a requester gives you a
      form other than Form W-9 to request  your TIN, you must use the requester's
      form if it is substantially similar to  this Form W-9.
      <br>
      <strong>Definition of a U.S. person. </strong>For federal  tax purposes, you
      are considered a U.S. person if you are:
      <ul >
         <li>
            An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;
         </li>
         <li>
            A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized
            in the  United States or under the laws of the United States;
         </li>
         <li>
            An estate (other than a foreign estate); or
         </li>
         <li>
            A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).
         </li>
      </ul>
      
      <strong>
      Establishing U.S. status for purposes of chapter 3 and chapter 4
      withholding.
      </strong>
      Payments made to foreign persons,  including certain distributions,
      allocations of income, or transfers of sales  proceeds, may be subject to
      withholding under chapter 3 or chapter 4 of the  Code (sections 1441–1474).
      Under those rules, if a Form W-9 or other  certification of non-foreign
      status has not been received, a withholding agent,  transferee, or
      partnership (payor) generally applies presumption rules that may  require
      the payor to withhold applicable tax from the recipient, owner,  transferor,
      or partner (payee). See Pub. 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident  Aliens
      and Foreign Entities.
      <br>
      &ensp;The following persons must provide Form W-9 to the payor for  purposes of
      establishing its non-foreign status.
      <ul>
         <li>
            In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of
            the  disregarded entity and not the disregarded entity.
         </li>
         <li>
            In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner,
            generally, the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not
            the grantor trust.
         </li>
         <li>
            In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust
            and  not the beneficiaries of the trust. See Pub. 515 for more information on  providing a Form W-9 or a
            certification of non-foreign status to avoid  withholding.
         </li>
      </ul>
      
      <strong>Foreign person.</strong> If  you are a foreign person or the U.S.
      branch of a foreign bank that has elected  to be treated as a U.S. person
      (under Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) or  other applicable section
      for chapter 3 or 4 purposes), do not use Form W-9.  Instead, use the
      appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see Pub. 515). If you are a  qualified
      foreign pension fund under Regulations section 1.897(l)-1(d), or a
      partnership that is wholly owned by qualified foreign pension funds, that is
      treated as a non-foreign person for purposes of section 1445 withholding, do
      not use Form W-9. Instead, use Form W-8EXP (or other certification of
      non-foreign status).
      <br><br>
      <strong>Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien.</strong> Generally,
      only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms  of a tax treaty to
      reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income.  However, most tax
      treaties contain a provision known as a saving clause.  Exceptions specified
      in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to  continue for
      certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise become  a U.S.
      resident alien for tax purposes.
      <br>
      &ensp;If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception  contained
      in the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S.  tax on
      certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that
      specifies the following five items.
      <ol>
         <li>
            The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty  under which
            you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.
         </li>
         <li>
            The treaty article addressing the income.
         </li>
         <li>
            The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that  contains the
            saving clause and its exceptions.
         </li>
         <li>
            The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption  from tax.
         </li>
         <li>
            Sufficient facts to justify the  exemption from tax under the terms of
            the treaty article.
         </li>
      </ol>
      
      <strong><em>&ensp;Example. </em></strong>Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax
      treaty allows an exemption  from tax for scholarship income received by a
      Chinese student temporarily  present in the United States. Under U.S. law,
      this student will become a  resident alien for tax purposes if their stay in
      the United States exceeds 5  calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the
      first Protocol to the U.S.-China  treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the
      provisions of Article 20 to continue  to apply even after the Chinese
      student becomes a resident alien of the United  States. A Chinese student
      who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2  of the first Protocol)
      and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption  from tax on their
      scholarship or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a  statement that
      includes the information described above to support that  exemption.
      <br>
      &ensp;If you are a nonresident alien or  a foreign entity, give the requester the
      appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form  8233.
      <br><br>
      <h3>
         <strong>Backup  Withholding</strong>
      </h3>
      
      <strong>What is backup withholding? </strong>Persons  making certain payments
      to you must under certain conditions withhold and pay  to the IRS 24% of
      such payments. This is called “backup withholding." Payments  that may be
      subject to backup withholding include, but are not limited to,  interest,
      tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter exchange  transactions,
      rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, payments made in settlement of  payment
      card and third-party network transactions, and certain payments from
      fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup
      withholding.
      <br>
      &ensp;You will not be subject to backup  withholding on payments you receive if
      you give the requester your correct TIN,  make the proper certifications,
      and report all your taxable interest and  dividends on your tax return.
      <br>
      <strong>
      Payments  you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:
      </strong>
      <ol>
         <li>
            You do not furnish your TIN to the requester;
         </li>
         <li>
            You do not certify your TIN when required (see the instructions for Part
            II for  details);
         </li>
         <li>
            The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN;
         </li>
         <li>
            The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you
            did  not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for
            reportable  interest and dividends only); or
         </li>
         <li>
            You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to  backup
            withholding, as described in item 4 under “<em>By signing the filled-out
            form</em>" above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened after
            1983 only).
         </li>
      </ol>
      &ensp;Certain payees and payments are  exempt from backup withholding. See
      <em>
      Exempt payee code
      </em>
      , later, and the  separate Instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for
      more information.

      <h3>
         <strong>What  Is FATCA Reporting?</strong>
      </h3>
      
      The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a  participating
      foreign financial institution to report all U.S. account holders  that are
      specified U.S. persons. Certain payees are exempt from FATCA  reporting. See
      <em>Exemption from FATCA reporting code</em>, later, and the  Instructions
      for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.
      <br><br>
      <h3>
         <strong>Updating  Your Information</strong>
      </h3>
      
      You must provide updated information to any person to whom you  claimed to
      be an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and  anticipate
      receiving reportable payments in the future from this person. For  example,
      you may need to provide updated information if you are a C corporation  that
      elects to be an S corporation, or if you are no longer tax exempt. In
      addition, you must furnish a new Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the
      account, for example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.
      <br><br>
      <h3>
         <strong>Penalties</strong>
      </h3>
      
      <strong>Failure to furnish TIN. </strong>If  you fail to furnish your correct
      TIN to a requester, you are subject to a  penalty of $50 for each such
      failure unless your failure is due to reasonable  cause and not to willful
      neglect.
      <br>
      <strong>
      Civil penalty for false information with respect to withholding.
      </strong>
      If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis that  results in no
      backup withholding, you are subject to a $500 penalty.
      <br>
      <strong>Criminal penalty for falsifying information. </strong>Willfully
      falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject  you to criminal
      penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.
      <br>
      <strong>Misuse of TINs. </strong>If  the requester discloses or uses TINs in
      violation of federal law, the requester  may be subject to civil and
      criminal penalties.

      each holder of the account that is a U.S. person must provide a Form W-9.
      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>Individual. </strong>Generally, enter the name shown on your tax
            return. If you  have changed your last name without informing the Social
            Security  Administration (SSA) of the name change, enter your first name,
            the last name  as shown on your social security card, and your new last
            name. <strong>Note for ITIN  applicant: </strong>Enter your individual name

            any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Other entities. </strong>Enter your name as shown on required U.S.
            federal tax  documents on line 1. This name should match the name shown on
            the charter or  other legal document creating the entity. Enter any
            business, trade, or DBA  name on line 2.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Disregarded entity. </strong>In general, a business entity that has
            a single  owner, including an LLC, and is not a corporation, is disregarded
            as an entity  separate from its owner (a disregarded entity). See
            Regulations section  301.7701-2(c)(2). A disregarded entity should check the
            appropriate box for the  tax classification of its owner. Enter the owner's
            name on line 1. The name of  the owner entered on line 1 should never be a
            disregarded entity. The name on  line 1 should be the name shown on the
            income tax return on which the income  should be reported. For example, if a
            foreign LLC that is treated as a  disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax
            purposes has a single owner that is a  U.S. person, the U.S. owner's name is
            required to be provided on line 1. If the  direct owner of the entity is
            also a disregarded entity, enter the first owner  that is not disregarded

      Security Card, from your local SSA office or get  this form online at
      <em>
      www.SSA.gov
      </em>
      . You may also get this form by calling  800-772-1213. Use Form W-7,
      Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer  Identification Number, to apply for
      an ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for  Employer Identification Number, to
      apply for an EIN. You can apply for an EIN  online by accessing the IRS
      website at <em>www.irs.gov/EIN</em>. Go to <em>www.irs.gov/Forms </em>to
      view, download, or print Form W-7 and/or Form SS-4. Or, you can go to
      <em>

      15 business days.
      <br>
      &ensp;If you are asked to complete Form  W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a
      TIN and enter “Applied For" in the space  for the TIN, sign and date the
      form, and give it to the requester. For interest  and dividend payments, and
      certain payments made with respect to readily  tradable instruments, you
      will generally have 60 days to get a TIN and give it  to the requester
      before you are subject to backup withholding on payments. The  60-day rule
      does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to  backup
      withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the
      requester.
      <br>
      <strong>Note: </strong>Entering  “Applied For" means that you have already
      applied for a TIN or that you intend  to apply for one soon. See also

         <strong>Secure  Your Tax Records From Identity Theft</strong>
      </h3>
      
      Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information,  such as
      your name, SSN, or other identifying information, without your  permission
      to commit fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use your SSN  to get
      a job or may file a tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.
      <br>
      &ensp;To reduce your risk:
      <ul>
         <li>
            Protect your SSN,
         </li>
         <li>
            Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and
         </li>
         <li>
            Be careful when choosing a tax return preparer.
         </li>
      </ul>
      
      &ensp;If your tax records are affected  by identity theft and you receive a notice
      from the IRS, respond right away to  the name and phone number printed on
      the IRS notice or letter.
      <br>
      &ensp;If your tax records are not  currently affected by identity theft but you
      think you are at risk due to a  lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable
      credit card activity, or a  questionable credit report, contact the IRS
      Identity Theft Hotline at  800-908-4490 or submit Form 14039.
      <br>
      &ensp;For more information, see Pub.  5027, Identity Theft Information for
      Taxpayers.
      <br>
      &ensp;Victims of identity theft who are  experiencing economic harm or a systemic
      problem, or are seeking help in  resolving tax problems that have not been
      resolved through normal channels, may  be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate
      Service (TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS  by calling the TAS toll-free
      case intake line at 877-777-4778 or TTY/TDD  800-829-4059.
      <br><br>
      <strong>
      Protect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes.
      </strong>
      <br>
      Phishing is the creation and use of email and websites designed to  mimic
      legitimate business emails and websites. The most common act is sending  an
      email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise
      in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that
      will  be used for identity theft.
      <br>
      &ensp;The IRS does not initiate contacts  with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS
      does not request personal detailed  information through email or ask
      taxpayers for the PIN numbers, passwords, or  similar secret access
      information for their credit card, bank, or other  financial accounts.
      <br>
      &ensp;If you receive an unsolicited  email claiming to be from the IRS, forward
      this message to <em>phishing@irs.gov</em>.  You may also report misuse of
      the IRS name, logo, or other IRS property to the  Treasury Inspector General
      for Tax Administration (TIGTA) at 800-366-4484. You  can forward suspicious
      emails to the Federal Trade Commission at <em>spam@uce.gov</em>or report
      them at <em>www.ftc.gov/complaint</em>. You can contact the FTC at
      <em>
      www.ftc.gov/idtheft
      </em>
      or 877-IDTHEFT (877-438-4338). If you have been the victim of identity
      theft, see <em>www.IdentityTheft.gov</em>and Pub. 5027.

         <strong>Privacy Act Notice</strong>
      </h3>
      
      Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue  Code requires you to provide your
      correct TIN to persons (including federal  agencies) who are required to
      file information returns with the IRS to report  interest, dividends, or
      certain other income paid to you; mortgage interest you  paid; the
      acquisition or abandonment of secured property; the cancellation of  debt;
      or contributions you made to an IRA, Archer MSA, or HSA. The person
      collecting this form uses the information on the form to file information
      returns with the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses of this
      information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and
      criminal litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and
      U.S.  commonwealths and territories for use in administering their laws. The
      information may also be disclosed to other countries under a treaty, to
      federal  and state agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or to
      federal law  enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. You
      must provide your  TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax return.
      Under section 3406,  payors must generally withhold a percentage of taxable
      interest, dividends, and  certain other payments to a payee who does not
      give a TIN to the payor. Certain  penalties may also apply for providing
      false or fraudulent information.

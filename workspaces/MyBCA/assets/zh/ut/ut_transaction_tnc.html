        the Subscription, Redemption, and Switching of Mutual Fund Participation Units, and the
        change will be notified by BCA in any form and through any means according to the applicable
        law.

    <li class="content">My investment in the Mutual Fund Participation Units is based on the
        information contained in the Prospectus and Fund Fact Sheet of the relevant Mutual Fund
        provided by BCA as the Mutual Fund Selling Agent. There are no other forms of Mutual Fund
        offering documents provided and/or promised by BCA as the Mutual Fund Selling Agent to me. I
        understand that the Mutual Fund Prospectus and/or Fund Fact Sheet are the official offering
        documents of the Mutual Fund managed by the Investment Manager.
    </li>
    <li class="content">I hereby authorize BCA to debit my account as a Participation Unit Holder at
        BCA for the subscription/auto-subscription of Participation Units either in writing or
        orally through certain BCA Branch Offices that serve Mutual Fund transactions, applications,
        or other facilities provided by BCA as well as for any fees and costs incurred in relation

        Confirmation Letters in accordance with the applicable law.

    <li class="content">I am fully aware that the proceeds from the redemption of Mutual Fund
        Participation Units will be paid and/or the switching of Mutual Fund Participation Units
        will be processed no later than 7 (seven) bourse days after the request for redemption
        and/or switching of Mutual Fund Participation Units is approved by the Investment Manager
        and the Selling Agent. I understand that the period specified above may be changed at any
        time according to the applicable terms, and the change will be notified by BCA in any form
        and through any means according to the applicable law.

    <li class="content">I hereby confirm and guarantee that I am not prohibited from subscribing for
        or holding Participation Units under the applicable law.

    <li class="content">I undertake not to be involved in any activities related to money laundering
        or any actions that may cause an Investment Manager, a Custodian Bank, BCA, or a Mutual Fund
        to be involved or implicated in activities related to money laundering.
    </li>
    <li class="content">I fully understand and agree that if my identity as a Participation Unit
        Holder or a beneficial owner of Participation Units cannot be examined to the satisfaction
        of the Investment Manager or otherwise can be examined but the result raises the Investment
        Manager’s suspicions that I, as a Participation Unit Holder, may be involved in activities
        related to money laundering, the Investment Manager has the right to reject my request for
        the subscription of Participation Units and at the request of the Investment Manager, I, as
        a Participation Unit Holder, must redeem the Participation Units that I own. As a
        Participation Unit Holder, I shall indemnify the Investment Manager and BCA for all claims,
        losses, damage, costs and expenses (including but not limited to all losses and legal fees
        that may be incurred by the Investment Manager and BCA) arising therefrom or in connection
        therewith.

    <li class="content">I fully understand that the Investment Manager is not responsible to me as a
        Participation Unit Holder or a beneficial owner of Participation Units for any losses,
        expenses, or liabilities that may arise in connection with the rejection of my subscription
        or redemption or switching of Participation Units, for which I am solely responsible as a
        Participation Unit Holder or a beneficial owner of Participation Units.

    <li class="content">I, as a Participation Unit Holder, hereby authorize BCA to provide my data
        as a Participation Unit Holder to the Investment Manager, the Custodian Bank, and the

        Mutual Funds, or to a competent agency if required by the applicable law or for purposes of
        supervision by such agency.

        information that I have provided to BCA are true, accurate, and complete.
    </li>
    <li class="content">If there is a change in the data or information, including, among other
        things, information about taxation, that I have provided to BCA through any means, I will
        notify BCA of the change in the data or information no later than 30 (thirty) calendar days
        from the occurrence of the change or within another period as may be notified by BCA in any
        form and through any means in accordance with the applicable terms.
    </li>
    <li class="content">I, as a Participation Unit Holder, agree that BCA has the right to terminate
        its relationship with me as a Participation Unit Holder if it can be proven later that I
        have provided incorrect, inaccurate, or incomplete data or information, or that I have not
        notified BCA of any change in such data or information about myself as a Participation Unit
        Holder within the period prescribed by BCA.
